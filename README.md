# flutter_fly_connect

Recently I've been working on a tool set with some basic design principles:

1. Data is stored locally

Not connected to the Internet, the tools and services used are offline versions, providing lifetime paid applications.

2. Principle of least dependence

Focus on the essential requirements of the tool and try to avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.

- No ads.
- No recommended guidance
- Design based on Material You

However, for some tools, such as Flove, users have data remote backup and recovery needs, so I will design and implement an auxiliary collaboration tool application `FlyConnect`:

1. Free and open source
1. Support active discovery of Fly toolset applications and local application data management
1. Bind users and support data synchronization in the cloud
